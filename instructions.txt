In this experiment, we are studying how people learn new information on electronic tablets.
  
Your task will be to learn about two different New England states -- Rhode Island and Connecticut -- in preparation to answer some questions in a short quiz.  You will read a series of short texts about one state and answer questions about it, and then do the same thing for the other state. In preparation for the quiz, you will be asked to recall out loud what you remember from each text right after you read it.  You will have a limited time to learn about each state before you take the quiz.  

The texts about each state are all single sentences, which vary in the amount of information from simple “factoids,” to more elaborate descriptions.  So for example, if you were learning about Louisiana, you might read sentences like the following:

• 	The state bird of Louisiana is the brown pelican.
•	Louisiana was named by the French explorer La Salle in 1682 to honor King Louis XIV of France.
•	“Cajun country,” which includes most of the southern Louisiana Gulf coast, is home to a number of festivals that celebrate the love of good food like crayfish and jambalaya, and lively performances featuring the accordion and the fiddle.  
 
You will select each sentence to read by pressing a button on the screen, where each button corresponds to one sentence. The buttons will vary in size to indicate how much information is in the sentence. When you press one of them, it may take a while for the iPad to load the sentence. When the sentence appears, please read silently, taking as much time as you need to learn the information.  When you are done, press the red button at the bottom right corner. The sentence will disappear and a question mark will appear.  When you see this signal, please recall aloud as much as you can remember from that sentence.  Try to remember as many of the main ideas and details as you can, and there is no need to try to recall the sentence word for word. Rather, try to remember the ideas that you learned. When you are done, press the black square so that you can go back and select another sentence to read. 

Remember that there is a time limit for you to learn about each state. After you finish studying the sentences, there will be a brief break during which you will do a puzzle and then you will take a short quiz in which you fill in the blank with a word or short phase.

If this all sounds a little confusing, don’t worry.   There are some practice items to start.  

Please let the experimenter know if you have any questions.
