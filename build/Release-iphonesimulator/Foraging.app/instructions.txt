In this experiment, we are studying how people learn new information on electronic tablets.
  
Your task will be to learn about two different New England states in preparation to write a brief travelogue for someone who has never been there.  To prepare for writing the travelogue, you will select a series of texts to read one at a time. 

Here is how all this will work….

You will be learning about Rhode Island and Connecticut. You will read texts about one state and write the travelogue for it, and then do the same thing for the other state. The texts about each state are all single sentences, which vary in length from very short “factoids,” to longer and more elaborate descriptions.  So for example, if you were learning about Louisiana, you might read sentences like the following:

• 	The state bird of Louisiana is the brown pelican.
•	Louisiana was named by the French explorer La Salle in 1682 to honor King Louis XIV of France.
•	“Cajun country,” which includes most of the southern Louisiana Gulf coast, is home to a number of festivals that celebrate the love of good food like crayfish and jambalaya, and lively performances featuring the accordion and the fiddle.  
 
You can select how much information you want to review by pressing buttons on the screen, where each button corresponds to one sentence. The button will vary in size to indicate how much information is in the sentence. When you press one of them, you will be selecting one sentence.  The screen might momentarily turn gray while the electronic tablet loads the next sentence. When the sentence appears, you can take as much time as you would like to read it so that you can learn the information.  When you are done, press the red button.  A question mark will appear.  When you see this signal, please recall aloud as much as you can remember from that sentence.  Try to remember as many of the main ideas and details as you can.  There is no need to try to recall the sentence word for word. Rather, try to remember the ideas that you learned.  Doing this will help you learn the information so that you will be able to remember it for the travelogue.  When you are done, press the black square, and the buttons will appear again.  

After you have read all the sentences, there will be a brief break during which you will do a puzzle and then you can type your travelogue. Your travelogue can be in any form you like (e.g., paragraphs or a list), but please write it so that someone else who doesn’t know this will understand it.  So for example, if you could not remember the information in that first sentence very well, try to write something like, “The brown pelican can be found in Louisiana,” not just “Brown Pelican.”  

If this all sounds a little confusing, don’t worry.   There are some practice items to start.  

Please let the experimenter know if you have any questions.  

 
PRACTICE ITEMS

• 	The trumpeter Louis Armstrong was born in New Orleans.
•	Clifton Chenier, who is credited with inventing zydeco, also designed a percussive washboard called the frottoir. 
•	Hemmed in by endless industrial plants, Baton Rouge may not look like much from the road, but it is worth the visit for the capital grounds, the planetarium, and the architecture that shows African and
