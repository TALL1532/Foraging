In this experiment, we are studying how people learn new information on electronic tablets.  Your task will be to learn about different New England states in preparation to write a brief travelogue for someone who has never been there.  To prepare for the travelogue, you will recall aloud as much of the information from each sentence as possible immediately after you’ve read it.  

Here is how all this will work.

The task will take place in two parts.  In one part, you will read a series of sentences about Rhode Island, and in the other part, you will read a series of sentences about Connecticut.  The sentences vary in length ranging from very short “factoids,” to longer more elaborate descriptions.  So for example, if you were learning about Louisiana, you might read sentences like the following:

• 	The state bird of Louisiana is the brown pelican.
•	Louisiana was named by the French explorer La Salle in 1682 to honor King Louis XIV of France.
•	“Cajun country,” which includes most of the southern Gulf coast from Lake Charles in the west to Houma in the east, is home to a number of festivals that celebrate the love of good food like crayfish and jambalaya, and lively performances featuring the accordion and the fiddle.  

For each New England state, you will see some buttons on the screen.  Just as the examples above, the size of the dot indicates the length of the sentence. When you press one of them, you will be selecting one sentence.  Read it at a comfortable pace and when you are done, press the red record button.  The screen will gray while you say what you got out of the sentence. When you are done, press the black square, and the buttons will appear again.  When you press another button, the process begins again.  After you have read all the sentences, there will be brief delay during which you will do another task and then you can type your travelogue.  

If this all sounds a little confusing, don’t worry.   There are some practice items to start.
